        <h1>John Adams and Thomas Jefferson - Friends Divided</h1>

        <p>John Adams. Thomas Jefferson. Two of America's most important founding fathers 
            had quite an interesting history of their own.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>They met in the early stages of the 
            Revolution, and became close friends despite key fundamental differences in their world
            views.</li>
                <li>This friendship came even closer whilst they were diplomats in Europe.</li>
                <li>Once the French
            Revolution began, however, and especially when it came time to choose the country's first
            presidents, their differences in ideologies came to a head.</li>
                <li>A decades-long series of arguments
            tore their friendship in two and threatened to silence their friendship for good.</li>
            </ul> 

        <p>It took the savvy 
            intervention of another founding father, Benjamin Rush, who was good friends with the two, to mend 
            their wounds and bind the friendship together once more 'till the end of their days.</p>

        <p>Historian Gordon S. Wood tells a remarkable story of this friendship in his dual biography "Friends Divided."
            He describes each man's upbringing, education, political carrer, and ideologies in engaging depth. Wood also 
            examines how this unlikely friendship came together, threatened to tear itself apart, and healed in the 
            formative years after the American Revolution. He also analyzes how Adams's and Jefferson's views helped form 
            two of the country's first political parties, despite each man despising political parties to begin with.
